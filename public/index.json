Yet scientists and managers lack a robust theory to predict rates of carbon and nutrient transformation to inform water quality management decisions. I am developing simulation models that aim to efficiently and realistically represent the cycling of chemical elements in aquatic ecosystems. Rather than focusing on the cycling of a single element (e.g. carbon, nitrogen), I aim to model cycling of multiple elements simultaneously by leveraging linkages among elemental cycles. Such linkages can be conceptualized as a biogeochemical network, where the “flow” of elements through the network is governed by first principles like mass and energy balance.\n","date":1612828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612828800,"objectID":"661ba8dbae88bbbc02e7c4d8d263fca1","permalink":"/project/bgcnetwork/","publishdate":"2021-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bgcnetwork/","section":"project","summary":"In freshwater ecosystems, biotic cycling of carbon and nutrients determines the capacity of a waterbody to maintain high water quality.

As a newbie to the world of website architecture, I figured it was appropriate to begin this blog with a common coding sanity-check.\n Hello World!  Ok, I think it’s working.\nPurpose I’m hoping this site will provide:\n A platform to share and document things I’m working on and learning about, for my future self and for anyone else who happens to stumble upon it. A means for past, present, and future collaborators and employers to learn more about me and my work. A way to practice communicating my professional work and fun side projects. An excuse to experiment and play with static website development.   How I created this site I created this site using the R package blogdown, which uses Hugo and R Markdown to build websites. The blogdown documentation has proved quite useful and is actively being updated. Additionally, I’ve found the Wowchemy Documentation and Markdown syntax guide to be handy resources. Finally, I’ve learned quite a bit by simply experimenting.\n  ","date":1612828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612925971,"objectID":"3fc3f2ed6d230e897d90e99dc07e53e6","permalink":"/post/first-post/","publishdate":"2021-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/first-post/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to my new site!","tags":["Blogdown","Netlify"],"title":"Hello, world!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hyporheic zones (areas along and below the streambed that exchange water with the stream channel) provide habitats for microorganisms and host chemical gradients that together spur a variety of chemical reactions. The chemical composition of water that enters the hyporheic zone is thus altered as it travels along underground flowpaths before exiting the hyporheic zone and returning to the channel. Hyporheic zone ecology thus serves as a major influence on both the downstream export of carbon and nutrients and the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The influence of hyporheic zone biogeochemical dynamics on stream channel chemistry depends on both the rate of hyporheic exchange and the nature and rate of chemical reactions in the hyporheic zone. Collaborating with my fellow members of the Fluvial Landscape Lab at Montana State University, I am working to build conceptual, mathematical, and simulation models that represent the impact of hyporheic exchange on stream solute dynamics.\n ","date":1612828800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612828800,"objectID":"d9f4d5c556d7863849ec2d435879e962","permalink":"/project/hyporheicbgc/","publishdate":"2021-02-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hyporheicbgc/","section":"project","summary":"Hyporheic zones (areas along and below the streambed that exchange water with the stream channel) provide habitats for microorganisms and host chemical gradients that together spur a variety of chemical reactions.","tags":["Biogeochemistry","Hyporheic zones","Simulation Modeling"],"title":"Hyporheic Biogeochemistry","type":"project"}]
