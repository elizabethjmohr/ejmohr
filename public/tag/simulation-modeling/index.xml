&lt;p&gt;In freshwater ecosystems, biotic cycling of carbon and nutrients determines the capacity of a waterbody to maintain high water quality. Yet scientists and managers lack a robust theory to predict rates of carbon and nutrient transformation to inform water quality management decisions. I am developing simulation models that aim to efficiently and realistically represent the cycling of chemical elements in aquatic ecosystems. Rather than focusing on the cycling of a single element (e.g. carbon, nitrogen), I aim to model cycling of multiple elements simultaneously by leveraging linkages among elemental cycles. Such linkages can be conceptualized as a biogeochemical network, where the “flow” of elements through the network is governed by first principles like mass and energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hyporheic Biogeochemistry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hyporheic zones (areas along and below the streambed that exchange water with the stream channel) provide habitats for microorganisms and host chemical gradients that together spur a variety of chemical reactions. The chemical composition of water that enters the hyporheic zone is thus altered as it travels along underground flowpaths before exiting the hyporheic zone and returning to the channel. Hyporheic zone ecology thus serves as a major influence on both the downstream export of carbon and nutrients and the release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The influence of hyporheic zone biogeochemical dynamics on stream channel chemistry depends on both the rate of hyporheic exchange and the nature and rate of chemical reactions in the hyporheic zone. Collaborating with my fellow members of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hydroecology.weebly.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fluvial Landscape Lab&lt;/a&gt; at Montana State University, I am working to build conceptual, mathematical, and simulation models that represent the impact of hyporheic exchange on stream solute dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
