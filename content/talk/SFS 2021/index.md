excerpt: Biogeochemical cycling within hyporheic zones can substantially influence stream solute dynamics, yet quantifying this influence at the scale of stream reaches and networks is challenged by the need to represent both hyporheic hydrology and biogeochemistry.  We developed a mathematical model for simulating the influence of hyporheic flowpath biogeochemistry on entire stream reaches, and assessed model predictions with a mesocosm tracer release experiment. Our approach provides a simple way to incorporate hyporheic heterogeneity into models of solute dynamics at stream reach and network scales.
