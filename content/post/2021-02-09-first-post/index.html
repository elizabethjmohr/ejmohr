<div id="welcome-to-my-site" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
<p>As a newbie to the world of website architecture, I figured it was appropriate to begin this blog with a common coding sanity-check.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="hello-world"><strong>Hello World!</strong></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, I think it’s working.</p>
<div id="purpose" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I’m hoping this site will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A platform to share and document things I’m working on and learning about, for my future self and for anyone else who happens to stumble upon it.</li>
<li>A means for past, present, and future collaborators and employers to learn more about me and my work.</li>
<li>A way to practice communicating my professional work and fun side projects.</li>
<li>An excuse to experiment and play with static website development.</li>
</ul>

<div id="how-i-created-this-site" class="section level2">
<h2>How I created this site</h2>
<p>I created this site using the R package <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a>, which uses Hugo and R Markdown to build websites. The <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown documentation</a> has proved quite useful and is actively being updated. Additionally, I’ve found the <a href="https://wowchemy.com/docs/">Wowchemy Documentation</a> and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1">Markdown syntax guide</a> to be handy resources. Finally, I’ve learned quite a bit by simply experimenting.</p>
