Net-spinning caddisfly (Hydropsychidae) larvae are ecosystem engineers whose nets can both alter streambed hydrologic properties and create a novel habitat for microbial communities (MacDonald et al., 2020). Streambed hydrologic exchange and microbial biofilms both influence processing of organic matter and nutrients, so might the net-spinning activities of caddisflies provide an indirect control on water quality? I am working on a team of [Poole](https://hydroecology.weebly.com/) and [Albertson](https://www.montana.edu/alindsey/) lab members to find out. Read more about the project [here](https://www.montana.edu/news/19665/montana-state-researchers-earn-national-science-foundation-grant-to-study-caddisflies-and-stream-health).
