<p>Water quality in streams, rivers, and lakes depends on the biotic cycling of carbon and nutrients. Yet scientists and managers lack a robust theory to predict rates of carbon and nutrient transformation to inform water quality management decisions. I am developing simulation models that aim to efficiently and realistically represent the cycling of chemical elements in aquatic ecosystems. Rather than focusing on the cycling of a single element (e.g. carbon, nitrogen), I aim to model the cycling of multiple elements simultaneously by leveraging linkages among elemental cycles. Such linkages can be conceptualized as a biogeochemical network, where the “flow” of elements through the network is governed by first principles like mass and energy balance.</p>
