intro: "I am currently a data analyst working on air pollution at Environmental Defense Fund. I love writing code, visualizing data, discovering more efficient ways of working with large datasets, learning about new data science techniques, and puzzling through how to make my analyses as impactful as possible. I love-to-hate and hate-to-love debugging. Outside of work I enjoy running, cross-country skiing, knitting, and baking sourdough, among other things."
