intro: 
  I grew up in Chicagoland and attended college at Washington University in St. Louis, graduating in 2015 with majors in Chemical Engineering and Environmental Earth Science. Upon graduation, I had a sincere desire to apply my strong quantitative skills toward combating climate change and other environmental challenges. After an enjoyable 7-month  stint working on an organic vegetable farm, I landed an Americorps position serving with the national non-profit Trout Unlimited.  There, I monitored water quantity and quality and worked on a variety of stream restoration projects. Eventually I got curious enough to attend graduate school in stream ecology, where my budding interest in data science grew.
